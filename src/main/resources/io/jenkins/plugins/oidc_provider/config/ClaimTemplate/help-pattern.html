<div>
    The regular expression that needs to be matched.
    This plugin will attempt to use the regular expression provided to match the value of the claim.
    Then, based on the <code>replacement</code> field you filled in, it will perform a regular expression replacement operation.
    <br/>For example, if the claim value is <code>foo/bar</code>,
    the regular expression <code>pattern</code> you provide is <code>(.*)/.*</code>, and the replacement you provide is <code>$1</code>,
    the final field value will be "foo".
    If the pattern is empty, no replacement will be executed, and the field value will remain unchanged.
