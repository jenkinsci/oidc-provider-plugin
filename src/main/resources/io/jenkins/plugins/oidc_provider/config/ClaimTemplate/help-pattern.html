<div>
    The regular expression that needs to be matched should be filled in.
    This plugin will attempt to use the regular expression provided to match the value of the claim.
    Then, based on the <code>replacement</code> field you filled in, it will perform a regular expression replacement operation.
    For example, if the claim value is <code>foo/bar</code>,
    the regular expression <code>pattern</code> you provide is <code>(.*)/.*</code>, and the replacement you provide is <code>$1</code>,
    the final field value will be "foo".
    If the pattern is empty, no replacement will be executed, and the field value will remain unchanged.
